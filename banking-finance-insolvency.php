                     <p>India’s NPA ratio is higher than any other major emerging market and the Insolvency resolution in India used to take 4-5 years on average. The resolution mechanisms such as strategic debt restructuring (SDR) and sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A) made little difference, but with the introduction of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code 2016, and its various amendments since then, a time-bound process to resolve insolvency has been carried out.</p>
					 <p>Whenever any kind of default in repayment is made the creditors are bound to take control over the assets of the debtor. The insolvency resolution is proceeded with the help of various institution like Insolvency Professional, Insolvency Professional Agencies, Adjudicating Authorities- NCLT and NCLAT, Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board. A resolution process may be initiated against any person or organization who has been unable to meet its outstanding financial debt.</p>
					 <p>This has also helped the banking sector of the country as previously they were accused of selling the assets too cheap and were put in the ambit of complicity and corruption, now IBC has ensured that buyers acquire cleaned-up assets without any fear.</p>
